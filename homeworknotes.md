**Em v. Rem notes**

> - You want to us _**Em**_ when the size of the text needs to be independent of the container.
> - You want to use _**Rem**_ when the size of the text is relative to the overall document
- so if you have something that is self-contained, you change the font-size on the container and it'll change things all the way down.
- _Rem_ is more of a global change. Like, a layout style that's for the entire document. It changes _**All Font**_ 
- **_Rem_** is easier to figure out sizing because it affects the overall document. 

- 1 _**Rem**_= 10 pixels
- Other forms of measurement: Pixel,Point,CH-units,Inches,Percentages
