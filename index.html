            <p>Here at Bryant Bullies once customers purchase a dog, all sales are final, and you must
                sign a
                contract before
                we take any forms of payment. We do not immediately give breeding rights, in order to
                breed your
                Bully from Bryant Bullies
                you must purchase breeding rights separately. In the event that a customer breeds one of
                our
                dogs without purchasing the rights
                Bryant Bullies reserves the right to take legal action and receive and and all profits from the
                litter.
                Ask on of our members how you can purchase breeding rights along with your new family
                member.
