        <p>Here at Bryant Bullies once customers purchase a dog, all sales are final, and you must
            sign a
            contract before
            we take any forms of payment. We do not immediately give breeding rights, in order to
            breed your
            Bully from Bryant Bullies
            you must purchase breeding rights separately. In the event that a customer breeds one of
            our
            dogs without purchasing the rights
            Bryant Bullies reserves the right to take legal action and seize any and all profits from the
            litter.
            Ask on of our members how you can purchase breeding rights along with your new family
            member.
